Instead, it allows companies greater flexibility in crafting a narrative that aligns with their objectives and corporate identity. Through the annual report, companies seek to showcase their accomplishments,company values, and vision to stakeholders. In many ways, it’s fair to call an annual report a marketing and communication tool, whereas the Form 10-K is much more of a regulatory compliance document.
